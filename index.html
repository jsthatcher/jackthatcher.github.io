          <h2>About Me:</h2>
          <p>I’m a young Chicago native looking for fulfilling and educational full-time opportunities in development and desgin. I’ve been coding since my first day of high school and as a recent graduate from Dev Bootcamp, I am well-practiced at learning new languages and working collaboratively with others. I’ve gotten involved with programming and development because I love solving puzzles and doing so with like-minded people. I’m an avid list maker and have found that I’m a task oriented person who is always most productive when I have a to-do list. I appreciate nice indenting, the perfect variable name, and quality coding snacks.</p>
          </p>As I enter this un-guided phase of my education I’ve realized the importance of the communities I’ve learned from. I’ve been lucky enough to have been shaped by caring and supportive mentors in high school, college, and during my time at DBC. Being apart of a community that is driven towards all aspects of growth produces an energy that cannot be replicated. I want to continue learning and do so with people I enjoy.</p>

          <h2>Passions and Interests:</h2>
          <p>Having been raised by an artistic household by an art teacher mother, I’ve had a great deal of opportunity to explore my creative side. With a basement full of art supplies I’ve been able to experiment with countless medias. Recently I’ve been working with letter structures, fonts and and intricate color combinations. I’ve always been a creative person and hope to eventually move towards design.</p>
          <p>The majority of my photographic work centers around decay in urban and rural settings. Forgotten spaces uniquely display the passage of time and provide an opportunity to document artifacts soon to be lost.</p>
          <p>When I’m not writing beautiful code or painting beautiful things, you’ll probably find me riding my bike. </p>
